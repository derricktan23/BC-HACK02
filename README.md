 ##  Trinity Protocol 
**Problem Statement** Digitalization Within The AgriCulture. Build a dApp that addresses one of the United Nationsâ€™ 17 Sustainable Development Goals

**Problem**: And what are the possibilities to let all people participate in creating an impact in let this world sustain and get incentivized for their support and engagement to let it become a rule for everybody in our world in saving resources, protecting the environment, fostering reuse and more. Carbon markets are inaccessible, both too expensive and complex for common people like us to be involved. Public incentive programs and philanthropic investment are unable to create the scale necessary to help draw down enough real carbon to reverse global climate change.

**Who**: The effects of climate change are felt the world over, impacting billions of people every year. Participating in efforts to address climate change should be as easy as possible, to encourage equitable access and compensation. Carbon asset markets in their current state are inaccessible and difficult to participate in for small users like us.

**Why**: Climate change is real and is one of United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The polar caps are melting and it is only a matter of time before Earth reaches is impending doom and becoming inhabitable for humans to live. Current carbon markets do not allow for small users to pariticpate and use it to fight against climate change due to the high barriers of entries.

**Name/Description/How**: We Introduce Trinity Protocol, a protocol that provision Green Bonds NFTs and encourages people to save resources & protect the environment. Users can play their part in climate change with Green Bonds NFTs that leverages blockchain technology and Defi protocols to provide sustainable interests and protect our environment at the same time. Bond yields are generated through a hybrid mixed of Defi protocols and investment into green companies. By controlling payouts with our NFT smart contracts, we ensure that the interests user earn will be fixed prior to deposit and can guarantee a fixed premium upon maturity, which will incentivised regular Defi players to also participate in our protocol as our NFT bonds can also be used to hedge against Black Swan events.
